# TWRP for Galaxy Tab S3 (gts3lwifi)

## How to build

Set up AOSP build environment before following this guide.

Create a project directory and prepare to pull the source tree.

```bash
mkdir twrp-9.0; cd twrp-9.0
repo init --depth=1 -u git://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_omni.git -b twrp-9.0
```

Create a manifest file to clone this repository.

```bash
mkdir .repo/local_manifests
vi .repo/local_manifests/gts3lwifi.xml
```

Put this content into that file.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
    <project name="awesometic/android_device_samsung_gts3lwifi-twrp"
        path="device/samsung/gts3lwifi"
        revision="android-9.0"
        remote="github" />
</manifest>
```

Sync and build.

```bash
repo sync
. build/envsetup.sh ; lunch omni_gts3lwifi-eng ; mka recoveryimage
```
